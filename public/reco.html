    <li>
        <strong>Maricar</strong> by Maricar Reyes-Poon
    </li>

    <br />
    <p>
        In 2009, I was involved in a scandal that destroyed my reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
        For years I have chosen to keep quiet about the specifics of what I went through.
        Speaking out back then would do me more harm than good.
    </p>
    <p>
        But now it's time to write my story for women who may feel devastated & hopeless.
        I want to share what I've learned about the long process of healing.
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to let them know they are not alone. There is always a way out of a dark situation.

        <strong>Every Last Word</strong> by Tamara Ireland Stone
    </li>

    <p>
        Still, I can hear this one thought, hiding in the dark corners of my mind.
    <p>
        It doesn't attack like the others, but it's frightening in a totally different way.
    </p>
        Because it's the one that never leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
        And it's the one that scares me the most.
    </p>

        <em>What if I'm crazy?</em>

        <strong>This time will be different</strong> by Misa Sugiura
    </li>
    <img src="../assets/images/1d.jpg" width="150" />
    <p>
        <strong>Katsuyamas never quit,</strong> but seventeen-year-old CJ doesn't even know how to get started.
        She's never lived up to her mom's type A ambition, and she's perfectly happy just helping her aunt, Hannah,
        at their family's flower shop.
    </p>
    <p>
        Until her mom announces she's planning to sell the shop - to the McAllisters, who swindled CJ's family,
        and many others, when Japanese Americans were sent to internment camps during World War II. Soon a 
        rift threatens to splinter CJ's family, her friends, and their entire Northern California Community.
        And for the first time, CJ is ready to step up and fight.

        <strong>This is me letting you go</strong> by Heide Priebe
    </li>
    <img src="../assets/images/1c.jpg" width="150" />
    <p>
        Letting go is not a process that comes naturally to us. In a world that teaches us to cling to what we love
        at all costs, there is an undeniable art to moving on - and it's one that we are constantly relearning. In 
        this series of honest and poignant essays, Heide Priebe explores the harsh reality of what it means to let go 
        of the people and situations we love most - often before we are ready to - and how to embrace what comes next.
