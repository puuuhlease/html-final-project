    Hello fellow human being! I am Mary Ann and I prefer to be called by my nickname - <em>Meann</em>.
</p>
<p>
    In this page I want you to have a glimpse of who I am as a person living in this planet Earth. ^^
    Btw, I am from the "Pearl of the Orient Seas" - <em>Philippines</em>.
</p>
<p>
    I used to work as a (Wireless) Site Engineer where I supervise subcontractors in Macro
    Sites. This involves ensuring the health and safety standards on site, providing on-site
    technical support (testing, commissioning and device upgrades) and monitoring work
    quality and progress. I’ve also worked in IBS (In-Building Solutions) Sites where I was
    responsible for securing work permit, Integration and Migration, Installation of the
    new baseband unit equipment, board upgrade and quality assurance/control. This helps me enhance
    my communication, problem solving, time management and organizational skills. Now, I am on my
    journey in web development and other software technology. I am excited and a lil' nervous taking 
    this new path but nonetheless I am very open and willing to start this new chapter.
</p>
<p>
    On my free time I like to listen to music (mostly Taylor Swift's songs), listen to audiobooks, watch yt videos (mainly about leadership, cooking, independent living, DIY)
    and sleep. My hobbies as of now are reading books, biking, paper crafting and journaling. (here's my <a href="./reco.html">recommendation</a> of books and videos for anyone who likes it).
    
</p>
<p>
    My MBTI Personality type is <em>INFP-T</em>, and other years <em>INFJ-T</em> (I believe personality is not fixed and can change because people grow and learn, but I always fall under those categories) 
    I am the type of person who's intrigued by people and life.. I like reading books especially autobiographical where I get to feel and see people's experiences and lessons, stories that put me in someone else's shoes and learn from them (if you have recommendation, feel free to message me☺).

</p>
<p>
    I love the sky, the clouds, the stars, the moon - anything up above. 
    I love the trees, the seas, the mountains, the lightning & the thunder - the nature. 
    I love to feel the wind breeze. 
    I love hearing people's dreams, desires, secrets, thoughts, quirkiness, jokes, laughter, stories, experiences - life.
    I love supporting and rooting for people's goals and dreams.
    I love real people - someone who accepts themselves as they are, embracing every aspects of themselves - their quirkiness, weirdness and uniqueness.
    Someone who loves growth, openness and compassion. Someone who accepts others' uniqueness just as they accept themselves. Someone who also loves life.
</p>
<p>
    I am selective in every way.. about everything.
